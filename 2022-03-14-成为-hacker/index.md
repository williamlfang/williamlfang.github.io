# 成为 hacker


「黑客」似乎不是一个好词。我们往往望文生义，以为带着「黑」字，这个称呼便不是什么善茬。而现实中，各路媒体也略有偏见的报道以这个旗子做掩护的各种「黑料」，这导致我们以为「黑客」真的挺「黑」。

其实，「黑客」是一个英译词，词根是 「hack」。原本的意思是「带有攻击性的创造」，即通过拆解复杂事物以获得更全面的认识，并加以改造，使用符合自己的使用目的。而这个被改造的功能，往往也物品原有的功能不尽相同。故谓之「破坏性创造」。传播媒体大肆渲染的，其实是另外一种活动，「crack」，即「恶意的破坏、窃取利益」等。很明显，这两者的词性完全相反。

&gt; The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.

在计算机领域，「黑客」不仅仅指代一群特殊身份的人，还表示由这群人所组合而成的文化氛围。「黑客」成长于互联网分享的时代，受益于开源软件运动，对技术痴迷，钦佩大牛，推崇共享的精神。在当前，「黑客」精神已经渗透到社会生活的各个领域。

今天刚好在网上看到 **ESR** 多年前写的博客，讨论是什么是「黑客」，怎样成为一名合格且优秀的「黑客」，收益良多！

## 什么是黑客

黑客文件起源于上世纪六七十年代，与互联网分享、叛逆、创新、创造等时代特征融为一体：

&gt; There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you&#39;re a hacker.

黑客已经不再局限计算机领域，已经成为人们的一种精神

&gt; The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics or music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really independent of the particular medium the hacker works in. But in the rest of this document we will focus on the skills and attitudes of software hackers, and the traditions of the shared culture that originated the term ‘hacker’.

再次强调，黑客与「害客」不同：

&gt; There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but aren&#39;t. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn&#39;t make you a hacker any more than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no end.
&gt;
&gt; The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.

## 黑客精神

&gt;   To follow the path:
&gt;   look to the master,
&gt;   follow the master,
&gt;   walk with the master,
&gt;   see through the master,
&gt;   become the master.

- The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved
- No problem should ever have to be solved twice
- Boredom and drudgery are evil
- Freedom is good
- Attitude is no substitute for competence
