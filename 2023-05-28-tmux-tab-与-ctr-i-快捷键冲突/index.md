# tmux tab 与 ctr i 快捷键冲突


最近在整合 `tmux-vim` 的开发环境，准备把之前的 `prefix` 从 `ctrl-k` 更改为 `ctrl-i`，结果发现无法完成命令行的自动补全功能。在网上查了一下，原来是因为系统把 `ctrl-i` 与 `TAB` 键都当做一个操作指令了，从而导致按下 `TAB` 的时候，实际上是执行 `ctrl-i`，如果多次敲击，则会产生两条指令：`ctr-i ctri-i`，这个恰好了显示 `tmux` 的 `sidebar` 功能，反而不是完成自动补全了。

具体的可以参考这个 `StackOverflow` 的回答，[Tab issues with Vim while running Tmux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19204294/tab-issues-with-vim-while-running-tmux):

&gt; I haven&#39;t really configured anything in tmux besides remapping C-b to C-i.
&gt;
&gt; set -g prefix C-i
&gt; unbind C-b
&gt; bind C-i send-prefix
&gt;
&gt; While Tab and the Control-i are usually distinguished in GUI environment, they generate the same character in tty-based environments like terminal emulators. That character is U&#43;0009, which is the Tab control character. It is represented as the single byte 0x09 in ASCII, UTF-8 and many other encodings. All of the “C0 control codes” (ASCII 0-31) have keyboard equivalents that combine the Control key with another key (mostly letters, but also some symbols). The Tab control character is generated by Control-i.
&gt;
&gt; You can verify that (at least) tmux considers C-i and Tab to be the same by looking at the output of tmux show-options -g | grep prefix. You will see it has set your prefix to the key named Tab, even though you specified it as C-i in your configuration. You can also notice the same canonicalization in the output of tmux list-keys | grep prefix.
&gt;
&gt; You may want to pick a different prefix if you do not want to type Tab twice when you want to send one to programs running inside tmux.
