# Most influential books for programmers

These are books considered most influential for programmers from this [StackOverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-read).

## Why on Github?

Cause SO is cathedral, Github is bazzar ;)

Long answer: I frequently visit above thread. Over the time, such an active thread is closed, links to book sites are removed and I have to copy/paste/search everytime I go there. I am afraid they might remove it entirely.

So, the list is preserved here :)

## Original thread

What is the single most influential book every programmer should read?

If you could go back in time and tell yourself to read a specific book at the beginning of your career as a developer, which book would it be?

I expect this list to be varied and to cover a wide range of things.
